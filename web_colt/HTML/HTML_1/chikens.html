    <p>The <b>Chickens</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_junglefowl">red junglefowl</a> species that are originally from
      Southeast Asia. They have also partially hybridized with other wild species of junglefowls
    </p>
    <p>(the grey junglefowl, Ceylon junglefowl, and green junglefowl).[1] Rooster and cock are terms for adult male
      birds,
      and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is
      called a hen, and a sexually immature female



      is called a pullet. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food
      (consuming both their meat and eggs) or as pets. Traditionally they were also bred for cockfighting, which is
      still
      practiced in some places. Chickens domesticated for meat are broilers and for eggs are layers.</p>
